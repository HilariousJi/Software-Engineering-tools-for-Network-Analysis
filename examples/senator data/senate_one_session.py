# Function
# --------
# vote_graph
# 
# Parameters
# ----------
# data : list of dicts
#     The vote database returned from get_all_votes
# 
# Returns
# -------
# graph : NetworkX Graph object, with the following properties
#     1. Each node in the graph is labeled using the `display_name` of a Senator (e.g., 'Lee (R-UT)')
#     2. Each node has a `color` attribute set to 'r' for Republicans, 
#        'b' for Democrats, and 'k' for Independent/other parties.
#     3. The edges can be weighted by 'votes_agree,' the number of 
#        times two senators have cast the same Yea or Nay vote
#     4. The edges can also be weighted by 'percent_agree,' the previous attribute divided by the total number of votes in the session.
# 
# Examples
# --------
# >>> graph = vote_graph(vote_data)
# >>> graph.node['Lee (R-UT)']
# {'color': 'r'}  # attributes for this senator
# >>> len(graph['Lee (R-UT)']) # connections to other senators
# 101
# >>> graph['Lee (R-UT)']['Baldwin (D-WI)']  # edge relationship between Lee and Baldwin
# {'percent_agree': 0.19587628866, 'votes_agree': 57}
